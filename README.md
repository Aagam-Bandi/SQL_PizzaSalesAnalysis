# SQL_PizzaSalesAnalysis
In this SQL project, I analyzed pizza sales using four dataset tables: orders, order_details, pizza_types, and pizzas. The dataset was provided by Ws Cube Tech. Through basic to advanced SQL queries, I retrieved insights such as top-selling pizzas, revenue contributions, order distributions, and more. 

I used MySQL Server and imported the Excel files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis, leveraging joins, aggregations, and grouping to uncover key business trends and patterns in pizza sales data.
